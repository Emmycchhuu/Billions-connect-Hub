# Simple Guide: How to Push to GitHub

## The Problem
GitHub was blocking your push because it found your API keys in the documentation files. I've fixed this by removing the real keys from the docs.

## What I Fixed
âœ… Removed your real API keys from documentation files
âœ… Removed AI bot completely from the website
âœ… Cleaned up all bot-related code

## Now You Can Push!

### Step 1: Add your changes
```bash
git add .
```

### Step 2: Commit your changes
```bash
git commit -m "Remove AI bot and clean up API key references"
```

### Step 3: Push to GitHub
```bash
git push
```

## Your .env.local File
Your `.env.local` file is safe and won't be pushed to GitHub (it's in `.gitignore`).

## Summary
- âœ… AI bot completely removed
- âœ… API keys removed from documentation
- âœ… You can now push to GitHub
- âœ… Your real keys stay in `.env.local` (local only)

Try pushing now - it should work! ðŸš€
